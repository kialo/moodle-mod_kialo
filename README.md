## Description ##

Ideal for classroom discussions and argumentative reasoning, the free Kialo Edu plugin lets you host online debates in an innovative argument-mapping layout.
Its visual format helps students break down complex arguments into digestible units and structure them in easy-to-follow lines of reasoning.
Our [intuitive design](https://www.kialo-edu.com/p/eafa94b6-a86f-4540-88f4-2a6250115a26/94696) also makes student collaboration and teacher feedback a breeze!

### Our platform ###

Kialo Edu is designed to develop students’ critical thinking skills and enable thoughtful discussions.
Starting from a central thesis, participants post claims supporting or refuting the claim above, with these branching out to create an argument tree.
Students can work alone or together to discuss, plan an essay/presentation, or create a review resource on a debatable topic.
Researchers have lauded [Kialo’s effectiveness](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dtingley/publications/revolutionizing-teaching-and-research-structured-debate-platform) in facilitating rational discussion. 

Educators have a range of features at their disposal.
They can assign students specific tasks, like responding to peers’ claims or providing evidence for their own.
These tasks are easy to track for the purpose of assessment.
Teacher Feedback enables targeted and discreet feedback to be given to individual claims, while the Anonymous Discussions feature lets students explore ideas without being identified by anyone but their teacher.

Kialo Edu’s design encourages reasoned, respectful discussion among students, displaying arguments logically and prompting students to back up their positions with evidence.
