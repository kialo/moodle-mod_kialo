# Moodle Config

You can copy `config.php` into `/development/moodle` to apply some default settings useful for development.

`kialo-admin-preset.xml` can be imported at http://localhost:8080/admin/tool/admin_presets/index.php?action=import.
This enables web services for mobile (required for the mobile app) and enables debug messages for developers.
