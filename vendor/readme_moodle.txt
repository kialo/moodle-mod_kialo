Kialo Discussions - Composer Dependencies
=========================================

We use PHP Composer to manage dependencies of this plugin.
These dependencies are bundled with the plugin if you installed the plugin
via Moodle's plugin directory or using a release from the mod_kialo GitHub repository.

If you are working on the plugin locally, you need to install the dependencies yourself.
See the section "Dependency Management" in `development/README.md` for more information.
It includes instructions on how to update dependencies, and how to update thirdpartylibs.xml.
